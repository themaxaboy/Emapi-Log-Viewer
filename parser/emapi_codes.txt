Each expiration rule consists of an expiration symbol and an expiration definition, which are separated by the equal sign character (i.e. '='). The expiration symbol defines the time period for which the expiration definition applies for: The first expiration rule must have an expiration symbol that is either OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK or OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH. The remaining expiration rules must have expiration symbols that comes in a certain order with regards to the previous expiration rule's expiration symbol: OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH must be preceed by OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.EVEN_MONTH or OffsetIntervalSymbol.QUARTER must be preceed by OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH OffsetIntervalSymbol.HALF_YEAR must be preceed by either OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.EVEN_MONTH or OffsetIntervalSymbol.QUARTER OffsetIntervalSymbol.YEAR must be preceed by either OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.EVEN_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.QUARTER The last expiration rule must have an expiration symbol that is OffsetIntervalSymbol.YEAR. The expiration definition specifies when in the expiration symbol's time period the expiration shall take place: The OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK expiration symbol must have an expiration definition that is an English weekday (e.g. Friday). Example: An expiration rule equal to \"w=Monday\" means that inside a week the expiration will take place on a Monday. The OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH expiration symbol must have an expiration definition that consists of: OffsetIntervalSymbol.DAY followed by an integer between (and including) -15 and 15 but excluding 0 if part of the first expiration rule. A positive integer counts non-closed days from the start of the month (i.e. d1 means the first non-closed day in the month). A negative integer counts non-closed days from the end of the month (i.e. d-1 means the last non-closed day in the month). Examples: An expiration rule equal to \"m=d-3\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place on the third non-closed day counting from the end of the month. An expiration rule equal to \"m=d2\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place on the second non-closed day counting from the start of the month. OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK followed by an integer between (and including) -2 and 4 but excluding 0 otherwise. A positive integer counts weeks from the start of the month (i.e. w1 means the first week in the month). A negative integer counts weeks from the end of the month (i.e. w-1 means the last week in the month). Examples: An expiration rule equal to \"m=w-2\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place in the second week counting from the end of the month. An expiration rule equal to \"m=w1\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place in the first week counting from the start of the month. The other expiration symbols must must have an expiration definition consisting of a positive integer followed by the expiration symbol of the previous expiration rule, which in its turned is followed by a positive integer that is equal to or less than the first integer. The first integer specifies the number of the previous expiration symbol's time periods that the expiration rules' expiration symbol's time period consists of. The second integer counts previous expiration symbol's time periods from the start of the expiration rules' expiration symbol's time period. Examples: An expiration rule equal to \"o=2m1\" means that OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH consists of 2 months and the expiration will take place in the first month of these 2 months. An expiration rule equal to \"y=6o4\" means that OffsetIntervalSymbol.YEAR consists of 6 OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH:s and the expiration will take place in the fourth OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH of the year. Examples of expiration rules: \"w=friday m=w-1 q=3m3 y=4q4\" \"m=d1 o=2m1 h=3o1 y=2h1\" Special symbols: In addition to the symbols described above there are symbols with special meaning. The symbol OffsetIntervalSymbol.TODAY represents the current date (the date that the calculation of expiration date is based on) and the preceeding numeric (positive) value is added to that date to get the expiration date. This symbol cannot exist in any expiration rule but is predefined."

Each expiration rule consists of an expiration symbol and an expiration definition, which are separated by the equal sign character (i.e. '='). The expiration symbol defines the time period for which the expiration definition applies for: The first expiration rule must have an expiration symbol that is either OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK or OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH. The remaining expiration rules must have expiration symbols that comes in a certain order with regards to the previous expiration rule's expiration symbol: OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH must be preceed by OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.EVEN_MONTH or OffsetIntervalSymbol.QUARTER must be preceed by OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH OffsetIntervalSymbol.HALF_YEAR must be preceed by either OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.EVEN_MONTH or OffsetIntervalSymbol.QUARTER OffsetIntervalSymbol.YEAR must be preceed by either OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.EVEN_MONTH, OffsetIntervalSymbol.QUARTER The last expiration rule must have an expiration symbol that is OffsetIntervalSymbol.YEAR. The expiration definition specifies when in the expiration symbol's time period the expiration shall take place: The OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK expiration symbol must have an expiration definition that is an English weekday (e.g. Friday). Example: An expiration rule equal to \"w=Monday\" means that inside a week the expiration will take place on a Monday. The OffsetIntervalSymbol.MONTH expiration symbol must have an expiration definition that consists of: OffsetIntervalSymbol.DAY followed by an integer between (and including) -15 and 15 but excluding 0 if part of the first expiration rule. A positive integer counts non-closed days from the start of the month (i.e. d1 means the first non-closed day in the month). A negative integer counts non-closed days from the end of the month (i.e. d-1 means the last non-closed day in the month). Examples: An expiration rule equal to \"m=d-3\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place on the third non-closed day counting from the end of the month. An expiration rule equal to \"m=d2\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place on the second non-closed day counting from the start of the month. OffsetIntervalSymbol.WEEK followed by an integer between (and including) -2 and 4 but excluding 0 otherwise. A positive integer counts weeks from the start of the month (i.e. w1 means the first week in the month). A negative integer counts weeks from the end of the month (i.e. w-1 means the last week in the month). Examples: An expiration rule equal to \"m=w-2\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place in the second week counting from the end of the month. An expiration rule equal to \"m=w1\" means that inside a month the expiration will take place in the first week counting from the start of the month. The other expiration symbols must must have an expiration definition consisting of a positive integer followed by the expiration symbol of the previous expiration rule, which in its turned is followed by a positive integer that is equal to or less than the first integer. The first integer specifies the number of the previous expiration symbol's time periods that the expiration rules' expiration symbol's time period consists of. The second integer counts previous expiration symbol's time periods from the start of the expiration rules' expiration symbol's time period. Examples: An expiration rule equal to \"o=2m1\" means that OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH consists of 2 months and the expiration will take place in the first month of these 2 months. An expiration rule equal to \"y=6o4\" means that OffsetIntervalSymbol.YEAR consists of 6 OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH:s and the expiration will take place in the fourth OffsetIntervalSymbol.ODD_MONTH of the year. Examples of expiration rules: \"w=friday m=w-1 q=3m3 y=4q4\" \"m=d1 o=2m1 h=3o1 y=2h1\" Special symbols: In addition to the symbols described above there are symbols with special meaning. The symbol OffsetIntervalSymbol.TODAY represents the current date (the date that the calculation of expiration date is based on) and the preceeding numeric (positive) value is added to that date to get the expiration date. This symbol cannot exist in any expiration rule but is predefined."

If there is only one event that occurred at the same time the only event will have this field set to true. N.B. If any filtering is done (e.g. only subscribing to event relating to some order books) or if the event is part of a current value this field can not be trusted. N.B. This indicator is currently only supported to be configured on market by level flows (e.g. PUBLIC_PRICELEVEL_FLOW, MBL_L1_FLOW, MBL_L2_FLOW). It is configurable per TRADExpress installation if events on a certain public flow are visible as sequences. If events on a public flow aren't visible as sequences this field will not be set."
